This directory contains the vistrails package for latex.

It allows you to include the image generated by vistrails 
by calling vistrails directly.

To use it, copy vistrails.sty and includevistrail.py to the same 
place where your .tex files are.

add the following lines to the beginning of the latex file:

\usepackage{vistrails}

By default, vistrails will be executed at www.vistrails.org and the images
downloaded to your hard drive. 

If you want to use a different server, add the following to your tex file:

\renewcommand{\vistrailspath}{http://yourwebserver.somethingelse/run_vistrails.php}

Or if you want to run a local copy of vistrails:

\renewcommand{\vistrailspath}{/path/to/vistrails.py}

To embed the links in the generated images, use 
\renewcommand{\vistrailsdownload}{http://yourwebserver.somethingelse/download.php}
or just set to empty to make the images not clickable:
\renewcommand{\vistrailsdownload}{}

This extension uses python. If you don't have python on your path, use this 
to set the python interpreter:

\renewcommand{\vistrailspythonpath}{python}


Then include the following command where you would like to include 
the vistrails images:

\vistrails[host=vistrails.sci.utah.edu,
db=vistrails,
version=<version_number>,
vtid=<vistrails_id>,
tag=<tag>
port=3306,
buildalways, %will force execution or download
execute, % vistrails will execute the workflow after the user opens it after clicking on the image
showspreadsheetonly, % only the spreadsheet will be shown when the user opens the workflow 
pdf, % download images as pdf files
showworkflow, % show the workflow instead of the results
showtree, % show version tree instead of the results 
getvtl, % will also download the vistrail/workflow
]{width=0.45\linewidth}

The tag, port, buildalways, execute, showspreadsheetonly and pdf options are optional. 
The default value for port is 3306. 
If buildalways is provided it will always call 
vistrails, even if it was already called once for the same combination
of host, db, version, port and vt_id.
If tag is provided, version can be ommitted and buildalways is implicit.
execute and showspreasheetonly will affect the link on the generated pdf. If
execute is provided the workflow will be execute when open, and
showspreadsheetonly will show initially only the spreadsheet.
pdf will return the results from the spreadsheet as pdf files

The options inside { }  are the options you would give to 
\includegraphics{} command

After running at least once, VisTrails will cache the images and latex 
instructions. 
The latex code will be in the "cached" folder and the images in 
vistrails_images.

If you set the \vistrailspythonpath to a invalid path VisTrails will use 
the cached files.

The option -shell-escape needs to be activated on the latex command line:

pdflatex -shell-escape example.tex

Vistrails will create in the current directory a directory called 
vistrails_images/host_db_vtid_version with the png files generated by 
the spreadsheet.

See example.tex for a complete example of usage.
