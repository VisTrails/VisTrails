\title{Embedding workflows in \LaTeX\ using crowdLabs}
\author{The VisTrails Team}
\begin{document}
\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
This article shows how to embed images from workflows stored on
\url{www.crowdlabs.org} in a \LaTeX\ document. The images can be
workflow results, workflow graphs or VisTrails' history trees.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
%% Please refer to \\
%%  http://www.crowdlabs.org/site\_media/static/user\_docs/vistrails\_usage.html
%%  \\
%% for instructions on how to publish workflows on crowdLabs  and to \\
%%  http://www.crowdlabs.org/site\_media/static/user\_docs/embedding.html \\
%% for more details about how to use this extension.

After uploading your workflows to crowdLabs\footnote{Please visit
\url{http://www.crowdlabs.org/site_media/static/user_docs/vistrails_usage.html}
if you need instructions on how to publish workflows to crowdLabs}, you need the following requirements in order to embed the workflows in the \LaTeX\ file:
\begin{itemize}
\item Python (\url{www.python.org})
\item the file \textsf{crowdlabs.sty}
\item and the file \textsf{includecrowdlabs.py} 
\end{itemize} 

Both \textsf{crowdlabs.sty} and \textsf{includecrowdlabs.py} are
located in the same directory as this document and they should be
copied to the same folder that your main document is located.

\subsection{Preparing the \LaTeX\ document}

After copying the files, you need to configure your document.In the
preamble of the \LaTeX\ file add the crowdlabs package: 
\begin{verbatim}
   \usepackage{crowdlabs}
\end{verbatim}

As we mentioned before, the crowdLabs package requires Python to
run. If the python executable is not accessible in the PATH, you will
need to set the \texttt{\textbackslash pythonpath} command with the correct path for your environment:
 
\begin{verbatim}
   \renewcommand{\pythonpath}{C:/Python27/python.exe}
\end{verbatim}

Also, by default, \url{crowdlabs.org} will be used as the main server, but
you can use your own crowdLabs server setting the \texttt{\textbackslash urlcrowdlabs} command: 
\begin{verbatim}
   \renewcommand{\urlcrowdlabs}{http://yourcrowdlabsserver.com}
\end{verbatim}

\section{Embedding workflows}
If you go to \url{crowdlabs.org} and visit the details page of the
workflow you would like to embed, you will see a tab just below the
resulting image, named \textsf{Embed this Workflow}. Clicking on it,
will display snippets you can use to embed that particular workflow in
different types of documents. So copy the text displayed in the
\textsf{In LaTex} box. For example, we will embed the image produced
by the workflow
\textbf{Isosurface}\footnote{\url{http://www.crowdlabs.org/vistrails/workflows/details/1054/}}.

We copied and pasted the following text into this document:
\begin{verbatim}
\crowdlabs[wfid=1054,
buildalways=false]{width=0.45\linewidth}
\end{verbatim}

And it generated the image in Figure~\ref{fig:isosurface}.
\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\crowdlabs[wfid=1054,
buildalways=false]{width=0.45\linewidth}
\end{center}
\label{fig:isosurface}
\end{figure}

This is the workflow that generated the image above:\\
\crowdlabs[wfid=1054,
showworkflow,
pdf, % use the pdf key to generate in pdf
buildalways=false]{width=0.45\linewidth}

\vspace{1.0cm}
This was using volume rendering:\\
\crowdlabs[wfid=1046,
buildalways=false]{width=0.60\linewidth}

This is the vistrail containing the workflows above:\\

\crowdlabs[vtid=209,
% pdf, %uncomment this for using the pdf format
buildalways=false]{width=0.60\linewidth}

\end{document}
